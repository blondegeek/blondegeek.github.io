* I am a close collaborator of two black tortoiseshell [lionhead rabbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionhead_rabbit) named after two of my favorite physicists [Mildred Dresselhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Dresselhaus) and [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether). They frequently provide helpful discussions pertaining to symmetry and the tensor calculus of fluff fields.
* We call them Millie and Emmy for short. They like hay, bananas, carrot tops, parsley, and basil.

### [Modeling Matter(s)](http://modelingmatters.com) {#modeling}
I host(ed) a podcast that showcases early career researchers and the mental models they use to investigate the world around us. I'd like to get back to this project once I've gotten a better handle on professoring.

The "Cosmic Ray Chandeliers" is a science-art installation located on M.I.T.'s campus on the 5th floor between buildings 16 and 26. The Chandeliers illumiate upon detecting particles, called muons, created in cosmic ray showers. 

### The Lunch Experiment {#lunch}
The Lunch Experiment was an automated system I wrote with [Nate Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathaniel-thomas-18603079/) that invited grad students from different department to groups lunches. During the 6 months that it ran, the Lunch Experiment organized 150 "randomized controlled lunches" and grew a community of more than 400 grad students from 50 departments. The homepage had this on it:

I don't always eat lunch, but when I do, I prefer The Lunch Experiment.

Become the most interesting grad student in the world.

### blondegeek.net -- the oxymoron that came true
Iâ€™ve had blondegeek.net as a personal website since March 14th 2004 (yes, that would be Pi Day). In the summer of 2006 (between my junior and senior years in high school), I turned blondegeek into a t-shirt company. blondegeek's stock traveled with me to MIT for undergrad. Then after four intense years, countless problem sets, and a S.B. in Physics with a minor in Architecture later, we traveled to Berkeley where I earned my physics PhD at Cal. blondegeek's stock was nestled next to my physics textbooks. If you wear a blondegeek shirt purchased during this time and experienced a sudden understanding of quantum mechanics, cosmology, electromagnetism, or other delicious physics topics the proximity of that item to the respective physics textbooks and the laws of diffusion are to blame. :)
