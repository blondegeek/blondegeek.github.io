### The Lunch Experiment
The Lunch Experiment was an automated system I wrote with [Nate Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathaniel-thomas-18603079/) that invited grad students from different department to groups lunches. During the 6 months that it ran, the Lunch Experiment organized 150 "randomized controlled lunches" and grew a community of more than 400 grad students from 50 departments. The homepage had this on it:
