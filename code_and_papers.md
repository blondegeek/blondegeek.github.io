* ### [`e3nn`: A framework for Euclidean symmetry equivariant neural networks](https://e3nn.org/)
Convolutional neural networks for point clouds and voxels with Euclidean symmetries (3D translation and 3D rotation). The current code is a merger of the work from [Tensor field networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08219) and [3D Steerable CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02547). See [e3nn.org](https://e3nn.org) and [docs.e3nn.org](https://docs.e3nn.org/en/stable/) for more info.
